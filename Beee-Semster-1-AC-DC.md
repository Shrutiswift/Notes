### What is Rsistance, Inductance and Capacitance?
* Resistance- It is a measure of the opposition to current flow in an electrical circuit. 
* Inductance- An inductor is an energy stored device which stores energy in form of magnetic field and its property is known as inductance.
* Capacitance- It is the ratio of amount of electric charge stored on a conductor to the difference in electric potential. Unit- Farad.
  
## Electric Potential difference-
* It is defined as the amount of charge from one point to another in an electric field. Unit- Volt.

## Types of Elements-
* Active- Those element which have their own source of energy. Eg- voltage source, current source, transistors.
* Passive- Those element which dodnot have their own source of energy. Eg- Resistance, Inductance, Capacitance
* Linear
* Non-Linear
* Unilateral
* Bi-Lateral
