### What is Rsistance, Inductance and Capacitance?
* Resistance- It is a measure of the opposition to current flow in an electrical circuit. 
* Inductance- An inductor is an energy stored device which stores energy in form of magnetic field and its property is known as inductance.
* Capacitance- It is the ratio of amount of electric charge stored on a conductor to the difference in electric potential. Unit- Farad.
  
## Electric Potential difference-
* It is defined as the amount of charge from one point to another in an electric field. Unit- Volt.

## Types of Elements-
* Active- Those element which have their own source of energy. Eg- voltage source, current source, transistors.
* Passive- Those element which dodnot have their own source of energy. Eg- Resistance, Inductance, Capacitance
* Linear- Those element which have constant characteristics or which shows linear graph. Eg - Resistor, capacitor, inductor.
* Non-Linear- Those element which donot have constant characteristics or which shows linear graph. Eg - Vacuum tubes, transistor.
* Unilateral- Those element in which conduction of current is in one direction only. Eg-Diode, transistor. 
* Bi-Lateral- Those element in which conduction of current is in both directions in an element with same magnitude. Eg - Resistance, Capacitance, Inductance.

## Types of Supply-
* AC SUPPLY- It is referred as Alternating Current. The current that changes its magnitude and polarity at regular intervals of time. It easily transformed from higher voltage level to lower voltage level. Frequency - 50Hz
* DC SUPPLY- It is direct current. The current have same magnitude and polarity at all time. Frequency - 0Hz
  
## Types of Sources-
  * Voltage Source- It is as a battery or generator, provides a potential difference between two points within an electrical circuit allowing current to flowing through it.
  * Current Source- It is an active circuit element that is capable of supplying a constant current flow to a circuit regardless of voltage developed across its terminal.
