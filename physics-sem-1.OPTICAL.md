## OPTICAL FIBER
### What is Optical fiber?
* It is a flexible, transparent fiber made by glass or plastic to a diameter slightly thicker than that of a human hair.
### Parts of Optical Fiber: 
* Core- Thin glass center of the fiber where light travels.
* Cladding- outer optical material surrounding the core.
* Buffering- plastic coating that protects the fiber.
* Core having higher refractive index than cladding.
### Fiber Manufacture
  1. Glass-Glass Fiber Combination 
         GeO2- SiO2 core, SiO2 cladding.
     * B2O3 and F decreases the refractive index.
     * GeO2 and P2O5 increases the refractive index.
  
  2.  Plastic cad Glass Fiber
  * Higher losses.
  * Reduced cost.
  * Short distance.
  * LED as source.
  * Core Silicon resin RI = 1.45 at 850nm.
  
  3. Plastic Fiber
   * Very short distance.
   * Low cost, tough, durable, inexpensive.
   * LED as source.
   * High attenuation. 
### What is Refractive index?
   * The index of refraction of a material is the ratio to the speed of light in a vacuum to the speed of light in the material.
   * For air and gases n ~ 1 and for water n ~ 1.33.
   * More precise values for glasses lie between ~1.45 and ~1.48.
### What is Snell's law?
   * When a ray is incident on the interface between two dielectrics of different refractive indices.
   * n1 sin theta1 = n2 sin theta2
### What is Critical angle?
   * The angle at which total internal reflection occurs.
   * At angle of incidence greater than critical angle, light is totally refracted back to the glass medium. 
   * When angle of incidence is 90 then refracted ray emerged parallel to the interface between the media.
