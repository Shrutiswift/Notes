## DC Motor- 
DC motor converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. It follows Fleming's left hand rule.

## Principal Parts of a DC machine-
* Magnetic field system
* Armature
* Commutator and brushgear

* Armature- It is the rotating part of DC motor
## Constructional parts of DC Machine-
1. Magnetic frame or yoke- It supports the pole cores and provides mechanical protection to the inner parts of the machine. It provides low reluctance path for the magnetic flux.

2. Pole core or Pole shoes- 
* The pole core and shoes are made of thin cast steel or wrought iron laminations.
* It supports the field or exciting coils.
* They spread out the magnetic flux over the armature periphery more uniformly. 
* It increases the cross-sectional area of the magnetic circuit, as a result, the reluctance of the magnetic path is reduced.

3. Magnetic field or exciting coils-

* The enameled copper wire is used for the construction of field or exciting coils.

* The field coils of all the poles are connected in series in such a way that when current flows through them, the adjacent poles attain opposite polarity. 

4. ARMATURE WINDING- It is the heart of the DC Machine.
* The insulated conductors are placed in the slots of the armature core.
* It is a place where conversion of power takes place.
* It is classified into two types- 
  
* LAP WINDING- In lap winding, the conductors are connected in such a way that the number of parallel paths are equal to the number of poles.

* WAVE WINDING- In wave winding, the conductors are so connected that they are divided into two parallel paths irrespective of the number of poles of the machine.

5. COMMUTATOR- It rotates with the armature, is cylindrical in shape.

6. BRUSHES- The brushes are pressed upon the commutator and form the connecting link between the armature winding and the external circuit.
* END HOUSINGS- It attached to the ends of the ends of the Mainframe and provide support to the bearing.

* BEARINGS- The ball or roller bearings are fitted in the end housings. The function of the bearings is to reduce friction between the rotating and stationary parts of the machine.

* SHAFT- The shaft is made of mild steel with a maximum breaking strength.

## WORKING PRINCIPLE OF DC MOTOR-
1. A machine that converts DC electrical power into mechanical power is known as a Direct Current Motor.
2. It works on the principle that when a current carrying conductor is placed in a magnetic field, the conductor experience a mechanical force.

* F = BIL

## SPEED- TORQUE CHARACTERISTIC OF DC MOTOR-
* Shunt Motor- 
* Series Motor- 
* Compound Motor- A compound has a high starting torque together with a safe no- load speed.
