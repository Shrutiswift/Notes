## OPTICAL FIBER
### What is Optical fiber?
* It is a flexible, transparent fiber made by glass or plastic to a diameter slightly thicker than that of a human hair.
### Parts of Optical Fiber: 
* Core- Thin glass center of the fiber where light travels.
* Cladding- outer optical material surrounding the core.
* Buffering- plastic coating that protects the fiber.
* Core having higher refractive index than cladding.
