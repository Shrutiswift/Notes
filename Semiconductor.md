# Formation Of energy bands in solids
# Conductor
* The possible energy band diagram shows that the conduction band is overlapping with the valence band.
* This is because the lowest levels in the conduction band needs less energy than the highest levels in the valence band.
* The electrons in valence band overflow into conduction band and are free to move about in the crystal for conduction.
# Insulator
* The third possible energy band diagram shows that electrons, however heated, cannot practically jump to conduction band from valence band due to a large energy gap. Therefore, conduction is not possible in insulators.
* Example -e.g.-Diamond = 7 eV
* They donâ€™t conduct electricity even at high temperatures.
* Examples-wood, plastic

# Direct Band gap-
* Direct band gap semiconductor-Those materials for which maximum of valence band and minimum of conduction band lie for same value of k, called direct bandgap materials (i.e. satisfies the condition of energy and momentum conservation).  For example: GaAs, InP, CdS. etc.
# Indirect Band gap-
* Indirect bandgap semiconductors-Indirect bandgap semiconductors Those materials for which maximum of valence band and minimum of conduction band do not occur at same value of k, called indirect bandgap materials. For example: Si and Ge
