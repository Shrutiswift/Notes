* KCL deals with conservation of charge.
* KVL deals with conservation of energy.
* Mesh determine the current and used for planar circuit. 
* Nodal determines the voltage. 
* KCL is associate with Nodal analysis.
* KVL is associate with Mesh analysis.
* Nodal analysis can be applied for both planar and non planar network.
* Node: A node is a point in the network or circuit where two or more circuit elements are joined.
* Junction: Â junction is a point in the network where three or more circuit elements are joined. It is a point where the current is divided.
* Branch: The part of a network, which lies between the two junction points is called a Branch.
* Loop: A closed path of a network is called a loop.
* Mesh: The most elementary form of a loop which cannot be further divided is called a mesh.
