* KCL deals with conservation of charge.
* KVL deals with conservation of energy.
* Mesh determine the current and used for planar circuit. 
* Nodal determines the voltage. 
* KCL is associate with Nodal analysis.
* KVL is associate with Mesh analysis.
* Nodal analysis can be applied for both planar and non planar network
