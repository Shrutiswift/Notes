# Ultrasonic-
  Ultra- beyond 
  sonic- sound 
* Piezoelectric substance- Eg- Quartz-crystal oscillator.
## Properties-
* The ultrasonic waves cannot travel through vacuum.
* Their velocity remains constant in homogeneous media.
* The ultrasonic waves are reflected and refracted just like light waves.
* These can produce vibrations in low viscosity liquids.
* These waves travel with speed of sound in a given medium.
* These waves can weld certain plastics, metals.
 
## Applications-
* Ultrasonic flaw detection.
* Thermal effects.
* It is used in sound navigation.
* Cutting and matching hard material.
* Ultrasonic soldering and welding.
* Measurement of flow devices.

## Production-
* Magneto-striction generator
* Piezo-electric generator

### Magnetostriction effect: 
When a ferromagnetic rod like iron or nickel is placed in a magnetic field parallel to its length, the rod experiences a small change in its length. This is called magnetostriction effect.
* The change in length produced in the rod depends upon the strength of the magnetic field, the nature of the materials and its direction of the magnetic field applied.
 
## Advantages-
* The design of this oscillator is very simple and its production cost is very simple.
* At low ultrasonic frequencies, the large power output can be produced without the risk of damage of the oscillatory circuit.
  
## Disadvantages-
* The frequency of oscillations depends on temperature.
* There will be losses of energy due to hysteresis and eddy current.
* It has low upper frequency limit and cannot generate ultrasonic frequency above 3000 KHz.

## Piezoelectric Method-
* Principle - This depends on the inverse piezoelectric effect.


## Advantages-
* The output of this oscillator is very high.
* It is not affected by temperature and humidity.
* Ultrasonic frequencies as high as 5*10^8 or 500MHz can be obtained with this arrangement

## Disadvantages-
* The cost of piezo-electric quartz is very high.
* The cutting and shaping of quartz of quartz crystals are very complex.
